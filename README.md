I have deployed the application on Heroku.You can review it here: **https://rahulgandhi-react-search-app.herokuapp.com/**

1. Create a Procfile with the following line- 
	> web: npm start

2. Create a heroku remote.This command creates a new application on Heroku â€“ along with a git remote that must be used to receive your application source.
	> heroku create

3. The heroku git:remote command will add this remote for you based on your applications git url
